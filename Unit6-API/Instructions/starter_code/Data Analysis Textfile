Data Analysis

1st Trend
City Latitude vs Max Temperature graph visually shows us that countries with higher latitude had colder weather on the day of November 3rd (the day data was grabbed) and cities within the 0 latitude to negative latitude which is further south of the equator had more positive temperature in comparison. This data is a visual confirmation that southern and northern part of the equator is where you would actually start seeing more dramatic changes to the max temperature recorded.

2nd Trend
City latitude vs Humidity shows us that humidity level is fairly spread out amongst the cities with different latitude, however surprisingly cities with higher latitude is experiencing higher percentage of humidity as the scatter plot suggests higher saturation within the cities within 60 latitude points. 

3rd Trent
City Latitude vs Wind Speed scatter plot shows us that wind speed tends to stay within 10-20mph in all cities in the analysis, most points saturating in latitudes that are between 0-70 points. Also the outliers suggest that countries within thin the opposite spectrum of latitude tend to have higher wind speed recorded. This may be more consistent with more data throughout the month.
